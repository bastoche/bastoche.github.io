I have spent a week touring the Nagoya region to visit companies applying the toyota production system. They varied in size and industry, but had the following common traits:
- they are not doing this for fun or because some consultant told them so, but to survive
- they are passionate about their products, from steel coils to second hand books

In this post, I will share what I saw over there on the shop floor, and what a software engineering team can learn from it. Here's the gist of it:
> Most of the work being performed by a software engineering team is hidden, try to make it visual

> Not knowing how to perform a task is not an interesting challenge to solve, it is an issue

> The role of the team leader is to support operators in their day-to-day job, which means he should be both knowledgeable and available
