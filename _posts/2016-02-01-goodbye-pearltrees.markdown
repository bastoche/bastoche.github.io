I joined [Pearltrees][1] 3 years ago, and I'm glad I did. I worked with a bunch of talented people, discovered the tech start-up world, and dived deep into mobile and web development. I wish you guys all the best!

Hey, but I have a blog now! I can finally embed [my Pearltrees account][2] somewhere: 
{% include pearltrees.html %}
