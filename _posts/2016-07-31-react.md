Here are a [video][1] and the [slides][2] of a talk I gave (in french) during a [tech lunch][3] in [Algolia][4]'s Paris office.

The bottom line is that:

* we are building [Auchan:Direct's new website][5] as a universal [react][6] application
* we put it into production in less than four months
* it should bring us a great user experience while being crawler friendly
